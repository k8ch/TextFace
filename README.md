Telegram bot that takes a certain command and returns a text emoji. 
Dedicated to my love of '¯\_(ツ)_/¯' and to my laziness of copying and pasting it from internet all the time. 
Currently supports the following commands: 
shrug - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
tableflip - (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
tableset - ┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
disaproval - ಠ_ಠ
lenny -  ͡(° ͜ʖ ͡°)
In the future more commands might be added.
